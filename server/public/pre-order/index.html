          <p>When not in constant use, Backbone can last over 2 months without a charge! When used regularly for 8 hours per day, Backbone lasts anywhere from 7 to 14+ days before you'd even need to charge it.</p>

          <h2 class="mui--text-display1 content-header">How Does Backbone Work?</h2>
          <p>While wearing the smart posture support, your shoulders and spine are aligned in their optimal posture positions. This is done by adjusting the shoulder straps to support your correct posture (building good postural habits and proper posture muscle memory).</p>
          <p>[Photo: Show someone wearing a Backbone and using app. Perhaps another photo with the spinal graphic here.]</p>
          <p>The app connects via Bluetooth with the technology inside the smart posture support and senses your movement and body positions - allowing it to monitor your posture, track your activity, and more.</p>
