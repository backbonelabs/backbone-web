        <p>[Photo: A photo of someone wearing the product looking confident - perhaps with people in the background looking at them in awe or them shaking the hand of someone looking at them admiringly. They can have the product underneath their clothes and we can have AC add graphics to show an x-ray view of it.]</p>
        <h2>
          <strong>Feel Happier</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Studies show that having good posture makes you feel happier, have more energy, improves your self-esteem, and boosts your overall mood!</p>

          <strong>You Deserve More</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Products that don't have technology can't promise you much more than what they initially sold you. With Backbone, we can - we're constantly adding new features to provide you with new ways to improve your health. Here’s a quick look at the technology inside of our smart posture support:</p>

          <strong>SMART MOBILE APP</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Backbone's mobile app works together with its smart posture support to gently vibrate whenever you slouch, remind you when it's time to take a break and move around, track all your efforts, and more. Here’s a quick look at how Backbone monitors posture:</p>

          <strong>Get Reminders</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Backbone lets you know whenever you slouch or when it's time to take a break and walk around or get some fresh air. Choose a variety of different ways you would like to be notified or reminded:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gently vibrates the Backbone posture support</li>
          <li>Vibrates your smartphone</li>
          <li>Sends smartphone notifications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>[Video: We can show the video here that we shot from HAX that showcases Backbone’s vibration notifications.]</p>
        <h2>
          <strong>Always Improving</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>This is what makes Backbone shine. Great posture is extremely important, but why stop there? We're working on new features, constantly giving you even more ways to improve your health.</p>

        <h2>
          <strong>Long-Lasting Battery Life</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>Because of how energy-efficient Backbone is, you can go for weeks or months without charging it (depending on usage). Backbone knows when it's not in use and will optimize its tasks to save precious battery life. We're also working on ways to increase the battery life even further.</p>
        <p>When not in constant use, Backbone can last over 2 months without a charge! When used regularly for 8 hours per day, Backbone lasts anywhere from 7 to 14+ days before you'd even need to charge it.</p>
        <h2>
          <strong>How Does Backbone Work?</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>While wearing the smart posture support, your shoulders and spine are aligned in their optimal posture positions. This is done by adjusting the shoulder straps to support your correct posture (building good postural habits and proper posture muscle memory).</p>
        <p>[Photo: Show someone wearing a Backbone and using app. Perhaps another photo with the spinal graphic here.]</p>
        <p>The app connects via Bluetooth with the technology inside the smart posture support and senses your movement and body positions - allowing it to monitor your posture, track your activity, and more.</p>
