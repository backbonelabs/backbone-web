If you experience a medical emergency, stop using the Service and consult with a medical professional. We are not responsible for any health problems that may result from training programs, consultations, products, or events you learn about through the Service. If you engage in any exercise program you receive or learn about through the Service you agree that you do so at your own risk and are voluntarily participating in these activities. Exercise is not without its risks, and this or any other exercise program may result in injury. They include but are not limited to: risk of injury, aggravation of a pre-existing condition, or adverse effect of over-exertion such as muscle strain, abnormal blood pressure, fainting, disorders of heartbeat, and very rare instances of heart attack. The exercise instruction and advice presented are in no way intended as a substitute for medical consultation. We disclaim any liability from and in connection with our exercises. As with any exercise program, if at any point during your workout you begin to feel faint, dizzy, or have physical discomfort, you should stop immediately and consult a physician.</p>
        <p>Prolonged contact with wearable devices may contribute to skin irritation or allergies in some users. To reduce irritation, follow four simple wear and care tips: (1) Keep it clean; (2) keep it dry; (3) don’t wear it too tight, and (4) give your skin a rest by removing the brace periodically. If you notice any skin irritation, remove your device. If symptoms persist longer than 2-3 days after removing the device, consult your doctor.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>SECTION 17 - DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>

        <p>If, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms of Service, we are found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Service, our liability shall in no event exceed the greater of (1) the total of any subscription or similar fees with respect to any service or feature of or on the Site paid in the six months prior to the date of the initial claim made against us (but not including the purchase price for any Backbone Labs product), or (2) US$100.00.

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>SECTION 19 - SEVERABILITY</h2>
        <p>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>SECTION 20 - TERMINATION</h2>
        <p>If you violate these Terms of Service, we reserve the right to deactivate your account or terminate these Terms of Service, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice or liability to you.

      <div>
        <h2>SECTION 21 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>

        <h2>SECTION 22 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
        <p>You agree that any dispute between you and us arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, the Backbone Service, or any other Backbone Labs products or services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below.</p>
        <p>Governing Law: The Terms of Service and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</p>
        <p>Informal Dispute Resolution: We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against us, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting <a href="mailto:support@gobackbone.com">support@gobackbone.com</a>. We'll try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email. If a Dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or we may bring a formal proceeding.</p>
        <p>Both Parties Agree to Arbitrate: You and Backbone Labs agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.</p>
        <p>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting <a href="mailto:support@gobackbone.com">support@gobackbone.com</a> within 30 days of first accepting these Terms of Service and stating that you (include your first and last name) decline this arbitration agreement.</p>
        <p>Arbitration Procedures: The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, California, or any other location we agree to.</p>
        <p>Arbitration Fees: The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. We will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $10,000. We will not seek our attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
        <p>No Class Actions: You may only resolve Disputes with Backbone Labs on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed under our agreement.</p>
        <p>Judicial Forum for Disputes: In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Backbone Labs agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California. Both you and Backbone Labs consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. You and we both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.</p>
        <p>Limitation on Claims: Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Backbone Labs products or the Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.</p>
