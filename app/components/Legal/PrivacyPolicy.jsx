          Our Privacy Policy applies only to the collection, use and disclosure of personal
          information that you may decide to provide to us in your use of: (i) our applications
          for mobile platforms or devices and our web applications (collectively, our mobile and
          web applications are referred to herein as ("Backbone Applications"), or (ii) our web
          domains and subdomains (collectively, our "Sites"). These available options for users
          to interact with Backbone Labs, Inc. is collectively known as our "Services". For the
          purposes of the Privacy Policy, Backbone Labs, Inc., and all of its subsidiaries, shall
          be defined as: "Backbone", "we", "us", or "our".
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we modify this
          Privacy Policy in a material way, a notice will be posted in our Services and on the
          Sites along with the updated Privacy Policy. We will also update the "Last Updated Date"
          in the Privacy Policy. By continuing to access or use the Services after we have posted
          an updated Privacy Policy or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are
          indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If the modified
          Privacy Policy is not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the
          Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following policy states the practices that may impact you as a registered user with
          full access to our Services or a non-registered user of our Services (each a "Backbone

        <h2>Collecting Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>
          In the course of using our Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally
          identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally
          identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number,
          age, email address, and certain physical characteristics ("Personal Information"). We
          will collect, use, transfer and disclose Personal Information in accordance with our
          Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also collect non-personal information, which is data in a form that does not permit
          direct association with you or any specific individual ("Non-Identifying Information").
          Non-Identifying Information is aggregated and used to help improve our Services (defined
          below) by providing a better way to understand the Backbone User experience with the
          level of interest in various portions of our Sites, specific Backbone Applications or
          specific Third-Party Mobile Applications. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose
          Non-Identifying Information for any purpose; details provided in this Privacy Policy
          about what Non-Identifying Information we collect currently, and how we use, transfer
          and disclose such Non-Identifying Information concern only how such information is
          collected and used today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information may be used alone or in the
          aggregate with information collected from other Backbone Users. Our primary objective in
          collecting any Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information is to provide you with
          a superior and personally relevant user experience.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Collecting Information</h2>
        <p>
          In connection with registration of Backbone Users on our Services, we collect Personal
          Information which may include your email address, as well as information on mobile device
          type, mobile carrier, unique mobile device identifier ("Device ID"), Internet Protocol
          ("IP") address and geolocation, as applicable. We use your Device ID to make it possible
          to authenticate and understand your use of our Services that you may choose to access.
        </p>
        <p>
          Related to this information collection, our Services may serve ads that contain links to
          other Third-Party Mobile Applications, and we may utilize your Device ID to track clicks
          or other ad fulfillment metrics. Our use of your Device ID does not enable us to identify
          you personally, and we do not store this information in connection with your Backbone
          User account information. You may also be asked explicitly to provide Personal
          Information or Non-Identifying Information any time that you are in contact with Backbone.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Additional Collection of Information</h2>
        <p>
          If you choose to participate in a Promotion, We may request that you provide us with
          Personal Information such as your email address or mailing address in order to administer
          your participation in the Promotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In connection with use of our Services or Third-Party Mobile Applications, in addition to
          information on device type, mobile carrier, IP address, platform version, and geolocation,
          as applicable, we may also collect navigation, interaction and engagement information
          regarding Backbone Users.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Cookies & Related Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We use "cookies" to study traffic patterns and understand the effectiveness of marketing
          communications. Cookies we use can reveal, for instance, which pages are the most popular,
          how much time Backbone Users are spending there, and how they are interacting with the
          content on such pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may have the option to disable cookies by changing the options in your browser to stop
          accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the pages you visit. If
          you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to view or use all portions of our
          Services due to limited functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of our Services, including email messaging, use "click-through URLs" linked to other
          content on our Services. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in
          topics, Services usability and other measures of Backbone User engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually
          or collectively "Pixel Tags") in connection with our Services and to collect usage,
          demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a
          single pixel that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies
          on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages
          of the Sites, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of
          promotional or advertising campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use our Services, our servers automatically record information that your devices
          sends ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s or
          mobile device’s IP address, browser type, language, Internet Service Provider (ISP),
          referring and exit pages, time spent, information searched for, time and date stamp,
          clickstream data and other statistics. We use this information to monitor, analyze and
          understand trends, for technical administration of Services and Third-Party Mobile
          Applications, and to gather demographic information about our Backbone User base as a
          whole. We may use this information for product and services improvements, and in marketing
          and advertising services.
        </p>

          BY CLICKING ON THE "SIGN UP" BUTTON, WHERE APPLICABLE, OR OTHERWISE BY ACCESSING OR USING
          OUR SERVICES YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
          ON YOUR DEVICE.

        <h2>Disclosures Within Backbone Services</h2>
        <p>
          As a user, you may create your own profile, connect with other Backbone Users of Services,
          send messages and transmit information through various channels. Please remember that any
          communications you have via our Services, depending on, for example, the functionality of
          any Backbone Application or Third-Party Mobile Application connected to our Services, may
          reveal your screen name and the content of your communications, making this information
          publicly available to other Backbone Users. Backbone is not responsible for the activities
          of other Backbone Users or other third parties with whom you choose to provide your
          Personal Information or otherwise interact.

      <div>
        <h2>With Third Parties for Industry Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to sharing aggregated Non-Identifying Information, we may also share
          aggregated Non-Identifying Information with advertisers and ad networks ("Advertising
          Entities") with whom we have strategic relationships. Unless you specifically opt in to
          share your Personal Information, the information that we share with these third parties
          will only be used in the form of Non-Identifying Information to support user trend
          analyses and demographic profiling. Some Advertising Entities also act as Service
          Providers (defined below) to us, so in those cases we will share your information as
          described below.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>With Preferred Partners</h2>
        <p>
          We may share your username, email address and Device ID (collectively, "Specific Shared
          Data") with certain business partners ("Preferred Partners") for those parties to assist
          us with providing you with the aspect of the Services for which you provided such
          Specific Shared Data to us, and to use such Specific Shared Data to improve your
          experience with the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We only share such information with Preferred Partners pursuant to an agreement by which
          the Preferred Partner is under obligations not to disclose or use it for any other
          purpose. You may contact us by any of the means provided in the "Contacting Us" section
          below to request not to have such information provided to Preferred Partners,
          understanding, however, that if such information is not shared with Preferred Partners
          it may affect your ability to use or access portions of the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some Preferred Partners also act as Service Providers (defined below) to us, and in those
          cases we may also share Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information as described
          below.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>With our Service Providers</h2>
        <p>
          Disclosure of your Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information may also occur
          where we engage or employ service providers, vendors or other third party entities to
          facilitate provision of our Services (each a "Service Provider") (e.g., without
          limitation, improvement of our Services’ features, user account authentication,
          promotion and marketing, administration, analytics, crowd-sourcing, cloud storage and
          other related services), to provide the Services on our behalf, or to assist us in
          analyzing how our Services are being used. Our Service Providers may have access to your
          Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to
          disclose or use it for any other purpose.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Under Special Circumstances</h2>
        <p>
          At times, we may disclose information about you to law enforcement officials or private
          parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to
          claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the
          property and rights of Backbone or a third party, to protect the safety of the public
          or any person or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be or to pose a risk of
          being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. Such disclosures shall
          only happen with written request by the agency for the requested information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under another special set of circumstances, for example, in connection with a merger,
          acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may
          sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of Backbone’s assets, including your
          Personal Information.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Age Restrictions</h2>
        <p>
          Our Services require that you are the age of majority or have been legally emancipated
          pursuant to the laws your local jurisdiction or over the age of 13 and have consent to
          use our Services from your guardian.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Location-Based Services</h2>
        <p>
          For location-based Services, we may collect, use, and share precise location data,
          including the real-time geographic location of your computer or mobile device. Unless
          you explicitly opt-in to permit the use and sharing of your Personal Information
          regarding your geographic location, your location data will only be collected and
          used anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you. When you opt in to
          Third Party Application providers’ location services, we will share your geographic
          location with such Third Party Application providers in connection with their
          location services. Please note that some location-based services may require your
          Personal Information for the feature to work as intended.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Protecting Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          Backbone takes your privacy very seriously and employs administrative, physical and
          electronic measures to safeguard your information from identity theft and unauthorized
          access. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information,
          your account ID, login password or national identification numbers in a non-secure or
          unsolicited communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security,
          confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal
          data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you
          via email or conspicuous posting on the Sites in the most expedient time possible and
          without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law
          enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and
          restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Changing or Removing Information</h2>
        <p>
          You may email us at support@gobackbone.com to request that we delete your Personal
          Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor
          your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for
          legitimate business purposes. Specific Shared Data cannot be retrieved from Preferred
          Partners after its disclosure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where you share information with other users through the communication channels of our
          Services, you generally should not expect to have any ability to modify or remove such
          communications. Nor should you expect us to modify or delete your comments upon your
          request.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you participate in a Promotion hosted by us (where you may or may not disclose the
          information requested), you have the option to opt out at any time from such
          participation and the receipt of any related communications. Please follow the
          unsubscribe instructions provided in the relevant communications.

        <h2>Links to Other Websites and Services</h2>
        <p>
          If a Backbone User chooses to participate in offer-linked information requests or
          "clicks on" an advertisement or another third party link, such Backbone User may be
          directed to that third party’s website or service and/or be prompted to provide Personal
          Information in connection with such activity. The fact that we link to a third party
          website or service is not an endorsement or representation of our affiliation with that
          third party, nor is it an endorsement of such third party’s privacy or information
          security policies or practices or their compliance with laws. We do not exercise control
          over third party websites or services. These other websites or services may place their
          own cookies or other files on your computer or mobile devices; collect data; or solicit
          personal information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules
          regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. You have
          the responsibility to review the privacy policies and related statements of the other
          websites and services you use and the terms of the offers in which you participate. You
          agree that Backbone is not responsible for, nor will it be liable to you or any third
          party for, your interaction with such third parties or the information requests initiated
          by such third parties or the subsequent use, treatment or dissemination of the information
          you voluntarily choose to provide to them.
