      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies to our software services or sensor devices (“Devices”), our websites located at gobackbone.com, support.gobackbone.com, and shop.gobackbone.com (individually a “Site” and collectively “Sites”), and Backbone Labs mobile applications (the “Apps”). The Devices, Sites, and Apps are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Service.” By proceeding to use the Service you consent that we may process the data that we collect from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is subject to the Backbone Labs Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy may change over time, but if any modifications substantially change your rights, we will send an email summarizing the changes to the address associated with your Backbone Labs account and provide notice on the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          And remember, we’re here to help. If something in this policy does not make sense or if you have any questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@gobackbone.com">support@gobackbone.com</a>.

        <h2>When We Collect Data</h2>
        <h4>ACTIVATE A DEVICE</h4>
        <p>
          When activating a Device, you will be asked to download the Backbone App and enter information about yourself, such as height, weight and gender. We use this information to personalize your stats. The Device can collect data such as the number of posture training sessions you start or your weight, and transmit this data to us.
        </p>
        <h4>CREATE A BACKBONE LABS ACCOUNT</h4>
        <p>
          If you want to access data collected by your Device, you must create a Backbone Labs account. When you create a Backbone Labs account, we ask for some personal information, including your email address and date of birth. Your email address will be your Backbone Labs account user name, which you will use to log-into your account. We do not display your email address to other users. Instead, others will see the name or nickname you enter in your profile settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also create your Backbone Labs account using a different credential such as a Facebook account. We will ask permission to access basic information from that account, such as your name, profile picture, and friend list. You can stop sharing that information with us at any time by removing Backbone Lab’s access to that account.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>ADD INFO TO YOUR ACCOUNT</h4>
        <p>
          You can customize your experience by adding other types of information to your Backbone Labs account, such as personalizing your profile with photos or participating in discussion boards. Whenever you add this type of data, we collect it and store it in your account.
        </p>
        <h4>VISIT OUR SITES</h4>
        <p>
          We collect industry standard data from everyone who visits our Sites—even if you don’t have a Backbone Labs account. This includes log data that automatically records information about your visit, such as your browser type, operating system, the URL of the page that referred you, the different actions you performed, and the IP address you used to access pages on the Site. We use this type of information to provide you with an experience that’s relevant to your location based on the IP address, to prevent Site misuse, and to ensure the Site is working properly. We also collect data from cookies.
        </p>
        <h4>SYNC YOUR DEVICE</h4>
        <p>When you sync your Device through an App, data recorded on your Device about your activity is transferred from your Device to our servers. This data is stored and used to provide the Service and is associated with your account. Each time a sync occurs, we log data about the transmission. Some examples of the log data are the sync time and date, device battery level, and the IP address used when syncing.</p>
        <h4>BUY FROM OUR STORE</h4>
        <p>We do not view or store your credit card information. This is handled by our third-party payment processor. We store your shipping address so we can process your order through our fulfillment partner. If you are logged into your Backbone Labs account when you purchase something on our Site, we associate that order with your Backbone Labs account.</p>
        <p>Certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
        <p>We recommend that you read the privacy policies of these third-party service providers so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
        <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
        <h4>CONTACT US</h4>
        <p>Whenever you contact us for help, we collect your name and email address along with additional information you provide in your request so that we can provide you with assistance and improve the Service. If you contact us when you are already logged in to your account, the web form automatically pre-fills this information, so you don’t have to type it manually. You can also contact us on public forums such as Twitter or Facebook; however, we cannot maintain the privacy of your communication to us if you contact us through these channels.</p>
        <p>We only collect information about you when you’re interacting with our Devices & Services.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Why We Collect Data</h2>
        <p>
          We use your data to provide you with the best experience possible, to help you make the most of the Service, and to improve and protect the Service. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        <p>
          Contact information is used to send you notifications, and to inform you about new features or products we think you would be interested in. Please see “Can I Opt-out Of Receiving Backbone Emails?” for information on how you can opt-out of future communications.
        </p>
        <p>Data and logs are used in research to understand and improve the Devices and the Service; to troubleshoot the Service; to detect and protect against error, fraud or other criminal activity; and to enforce the Backbone Labs Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>De-identified data that does not identify you may be used to inform the health community about trends; for marketing and promotional use; or for sale to interested audiences. See “Sharing of De-Identified Data That Does Not Identify You” to learn more.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>What Kinds of Data We Share</h2>
        <h4>DATA THAT COULD IDENTIFY YOU</h4>
        <p>
          Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is data that includes a personal identifier like your name, email or address, or data that could reasonably be linked back to you. We will only share this data under the following circumstances:
        </p>
        <p>
          With companies that are contractually engaged in providing us with services, such as order fulfillment, email management and credit card processing. These companies are obligated by contract to safeguard any PII they receive from us.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, valid legal process (e.g., subpoenas or warrants served on us), or governmental or regulatory request, to enforce or apply the Backbone Labs Terms of Service or Terms and Conditions for Online Offers to Purchase, to protect the security or integrity of the Service, and/or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Backbone Labs, its employees, users, or others. If we are going to release your data, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance by email, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may disclose or transfer your PII in connection with the sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of assets or reorganization of our company. We will notify you if a different company will receive your PII and the promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your data as transferred to the new entity.
        </p>
        <h4>DATA THAT DOES NOT IDENTIFY YOU (DE-IDENTIFIED DATA)</h4>
        <p>
          Backbone Labs may share or sell aggregated, de-identified data that does not identify you, with partners and the public in a variety of ways, such as by providing research or reports about health and fitness. When we provide this information, we perform appropriate procedures so that the data does not identify you.
        </p>
        <h4>DATA THAT YOU DIRECT US TO SHARE</h4>
        <p>
          You can direct us to share data with other parties. For example, you might direct us to share data with your employer as part of a wellness program. Once you direct us to share your data with a third party, that data is governed by the third-party’s privacy policy. You can revoke your consent to share with the third party at any time in your Backbone Labs account settings.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Ways You Might Share Your Data</h2>
        <h4>BACKBONE LABS SOCIAL TOOLS</h4>
        <p>
          We may provide ways for you to share data with other users, such as with a leaderboard, challenges, or by posting comments to the Backbone Labs community message boards. When you interact with others in these ways, you will be displaying your data based upon the settings in your Backbone Labs account settings.
        </p>
        <h4>COMMUNITY POSTS</h4>
        <p>To post to our community message boards, you’ll be asked to create a community username that’s separate from your Backbone Labs profile name. This community username will be posted next to any comments you publish on community message boards. Other information, like a profile photo that you’ve added to your Backbone Labs account will also be visible on message boards, depending on your Backbone Labs account settings.</p>
        <h4>CONTESTS AND GIVEAWAYS</h4>
        <p>We may offer opportunities to participate in contests, giveaways and other promotions. Any data you submit in connection with these activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless the rules for those offers note otherwise.</p>
        <h4>SURVEYS</h4>
        <p>We may also ask you to participate in surveys (processed by us or third parties) that help us understand your use of the Service. Any PII you provide to us (or supplied by you or us to such third-party survey providers) in connection with these surveys will only be used in relation to that survey and as stated in this policy.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>How Long We Save Your Data</h2>
        <p>We store your PII for as long as you maintain a Backbone Labs account.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>How to Edit or Modify Data</h2>
        <p>
          Data that you provide to us through the Site can be modified from your Backbone Labs account preferences. If you remove data from your Backbone Labs account, it will no longer appear to you or others who use the Service. Backups of that data will remain associated with your Backbone Labs account and in our archive servers.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>How to Deactivate Your Backbone Labs Account</h2>
        <p>
          You can deactivate your Backbone Labs account by contacting Customer Support. When you do, data that can identify you will be removed from the Service. Backup copies of this data will be removed from our server based upon an automated schedule, which means it may persist in our archive for a short period. Backbone Labs may continue to use your de-identified data after you deactivate your account.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Our Policies for Children</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Can I Opt-Out of Receiving Backbone Labs Emails?</h2>
        <p>
          You can opt-out of receiving weekly summaries, achievement notifications, contests, giveaways, surveys and promotional emails by changing the notification preferences in your account settings or by unsubscribing via the “Unsubscribe” link in any Backbone Labs email. Opting-out of these emails will not end transmission of important service-related emails that are necessary to your use of the Service.

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>How Does Backbone Labs Keep Your Data Safe?</h2>

        <h2>How Does Backbone Labs Handle Data from International Visitors?</h2>
        <p>
          The Services are hosted in the United States and are subject to United States law. We may share your personal information internally with our affiliates and other recipients, as described in this Privacy Policy, and they may be located in countries other than your country. If you are accessing the Services from outside the United States, please be advised that United States law and other countries may not offer the same privacy protections as the law of your jurisdiction.

      <div>
        <h2>Cookies, Pixel Tags and Other Data Identifiers</h2>
        <p>
          In some instances, we may collect data through session and persistent cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and banner ads and third party tracking and analytic tools used to collect aggregate and other non-personally identifiable information. For example, when you visit our websites, a session log will be automatically generated to help us determine how you accessed and used our site. The data gathered includes the originating Internet Protocol (IP) address (which contains no personal information), the referring website, the website pages you visited, and other related session and activity data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also use information collected from cookies and other anonymous identifiers to improve your user experience and the quality of our services, as well as when you interact with services we offer to or through our partners, such as advertising or commerce services. We only use this data in aggregate form without access to any personally identifying information. The majority of web browsers accept cookies and similar files, but you can usually change the browser settings to prevent this. However, if you do so, some functionality of our site may be impaired or lost, particularly any site customization features.
